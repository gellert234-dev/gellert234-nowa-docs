# Constraints

Constraints dictate the behavior of objects when the screens are resized, allowing for consistent appearance of designs on various screen sizes and devices. They can be applied both on the horizontal and vertical axis.

### Horizontal constraints
**Right**: the object stays in place relative to the left side of the screen. 
**Left**: the object stays in place relative to the left side of the screen. 
**Left and right**: constraint keeps the object's size and position in relation to both sides of the frame, which may result in the object changing size along the X axis upon resizing.

### Vertical constraints
**Top**: the object stays in place relative to the top of the screen. 
**Bottom**: the object stays in place relative to the bottom of the screen. 
**Top and bottom**: constraint keeps the object's size and position in relation to both top and bottom of the screen, which may result in the object changing size along the Y axis upon resizing.

### Center
You can set the constraints to "**Center**" to maintain the position of the object relative to the center of the screen.
