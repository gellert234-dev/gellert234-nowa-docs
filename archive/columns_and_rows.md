# Columns and Rows

Nowa's layout options allow you to create any design that can adapt automatically buy organizing them in columns and rows.

You can distribute object in a column or a row by grouping them, and then selecting the direction you want from the details panel.  [â†“]  [â†’]

ðŸ’¡Tip: If you select items with a container below them and turn the selection into a group/column/row, the container below will become a wrapper that gives a fill color to your  group/column/row.

### Alignment
You can choose the alignment of your objects inside the column or row. The alignment options depend on the direction in which your objects are distributed. 
To control the alignment of the objects, select the parent column or row and select one of the nine options inside the alignment box.

If you selected the spacing to be something other that fixed, then your alignment options will be 3 for each direction.
- Column: Top, Center, Bottom.
- Row: Left, Center, Right.

### Spacing

**Fixed** â†’ manually set the space to be specific number/value.
**Between** â†’ evenly distributes space items between the first item is set at the start of the container, and the last item is set at the end.

You can choose between three options: Fixed, Auto, Expand.

**Fixed**
When the width or height of a column/row is set to fixed, it means that the value remain the same regardless of the content's size inside them, and it will not change if the children inside change. 
Same will be the behaviour of children inside a column/row if their width of height is set to Fixed.

**Auto**
When the column/row size is set to Auto, it will resize itself to surround the children.
If there is padding set, the column/row will maintain it.

**Expand**
The children inside a column/row can have their width and height value set to Expand. When this option is selected, the child will stretch its width/height in order to fill the size of its parent. 

### Reordering
You can rearrange your widgets inside a column or a row by easy drag and drop them from inside the column/row or buy reordering them in the details panel.
