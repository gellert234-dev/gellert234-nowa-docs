### Understanding boards

Boards are simply a design canvases where you can design and organize multiple screens and components in a single interface, without having to switch between different pages or screens.

### Creating a new board

To create a new board, simply click on the plus button located in the board tab. You will see a list of all the boards in the project with an option to create a new board. Click on the last option. Once created, the board will be saved in your assets and can be easily reopened from there.

### Customizing your board:

Your board is your play field! Using the details panel, you can customize your board background color and showing/hiding the grid. This allows you to create a visually appealing workspace tailored to your design preferences.

Your board settings will be saved, therfore when you close it and open it again, your customization will be there. Also each board have it's own customization, so you can customize a board without affecting the others.

 
### How to use boards efficiently:

In order to get the most value out of the boards, it's important to know what to keep in a single board and what to split into multiple boards. Try to include only the design elements that are related to each other and you need to work on them at the same time in a single board, otherwise it's good to seperate them into multiple boards to keep it clean and organized. 

You don't want to have every design in a different board so you spend it switching, but also you don't want to have them all in a single board where it's just a mess.
