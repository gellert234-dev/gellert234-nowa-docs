## Group Properties

**Alignment** â†’ Choose where your widgets should sit inside the group, like in the center, top-left, or bottom-right.

**Text Direction** â†’ Determines the order and direction in which the child widgets are laid out, especially when dealing with text or any sequence-dependent widgets.

**Fit** â†’ Defines how the size of the group is determined relative to its parent and its children.

**Children** â†’ The Children property lists all the widgets that are included within the group. You can add new widgets from here that will go inside the group.
