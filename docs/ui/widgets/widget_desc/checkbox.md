# Checkbox

The "Checkbox" widget allows users to select or deselect an option, commonly used in forms and settings. Here's an explanation of its features:

- **Value:** This determines whether the checkbox is checked, unchecked, or indeterminate. Setting this controls the current state of the checkbox.

- **Tristate:** When enabled, the checkbox supports three states: checked, unchecked, and indeterminate (neither checked nor unchecked), adding flexibility for complex scenarios.

- **On Changed:** This function is called when the checkbox's value changes (when it's tapped). It's used to update the state and perform actions based on the new value.

- **Active Color:** Sets the color of the checkbox when it's checked, allowing you to customize it to fit your app's design.

- **Check Color:** Changes the color of the check mark inside the checkbox, providing contrast against the active color.

- **Focus Color:** Determines the color of the checkbox's outline when it has focus, improving accessibility and visual cues.

- **Hover Color:** Sets the color of the checkbox when a cursor hovers over it, useful for desktop platforms to indicate an interactive element.

- **Splash Radius:** Adjusts the radius of the ink splash animation that appears when the checkbox is tapped, allowing for a more customized interaction effect.

- **Autofocus:** When set to true, the checkbox will be focused automatically when the page loads, making navigation more intuitive.

- **Side:** Allows customization of the border's appearance around the checkbox, giving more control over its style and visibility.

- **Is Error:** Indicates whether the checkbox is in an error state, typically used to signal to users that their selection has caused an error in a form or setting.

- **Semantic Label:** Provides a text description for the checkbox, improving accessibility by describing its purpose to users who rely on screen readers.
