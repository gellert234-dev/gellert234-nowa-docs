[Lottie](https://lottiefiles.com/) is an open-source animation library, allowing developers to easily integrate high-quality, interactive animations into their applications. It simplifies the animation process by using JSON files created in Adobe After Effects, providing a platform-agnostic format for consistent and efficient animation across various frameworks and platforms.
