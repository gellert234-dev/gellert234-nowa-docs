# Create and Manage Projects

In Nowa each project you create is essentially an app, which can be stored either on the cloud for easy access from anywhere or locally on your device for added security and control.

## Creating Projects

1.  **Access the Dashboard:** Log into your account to access the main dashboard. This is where you'll manage all your projects.
2. **Create a New Project:** Click on the "Create" button. Enter a name for your project and select to store it on the cloud or locally.

## Workspaces

Nowa offers you the opportunity to create multiple workspaces, allowing for better organization of your projects.

To create a new workspace, simply click on the "My Projects" button located on the dashboard, and then select "Create Workspace". A pop-up window will appear, enabling you to choose a name and color for the workspace, making it more easily identifiable.

If you wish to make modifications or delete a workspace, navigate to the same menu and click on the pen icon located next to the desired workspace.

⚠️ Please note that workspaces containing projects cannot be deleted for safety reasons.

If you have the Team plan, you have the option to add member is your workspace. Find out how to accomplish this by checking [Add members to a workspace](../collaboration/adding_members.md)
