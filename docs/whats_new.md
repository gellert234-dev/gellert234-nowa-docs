### **2.0.8-beta (28 Nov 2024)**

Nowa V2 is here! After 7 weeks of exclusive testing with hand-picked users, weâ€™re happy to open Nowa V2 to everyone!

This version introduces groundbreaking new features, an improved workflow, and an enhanced overall experience. Letâ€™s dive into the details.

#### **New âœ¨**

- **A Unified Workflow:** The new workflow eliminates friction, allowing seamless navigation and improved productivity throughout the app-building process. Here's some of the new improvements on the workflow:

  - **UI Boards:** Organize all your UIs on visual boards for a clear overview of your project.
  - **Focused File Tabs:** Open individual files in their own tabs, allowing you to fully focus on specific components.
  - **Declaration Navigation:** For files with multiple declarations (e.g., multiple widgets), use the declaration chips on the bottom-left panel to switch between them effortlessly.
  - **Isolated Screen Testing:** Play an isolated screen directly from the file preview to test its behavior in isolation.
  - **Code View:** Access the code for any file by clicking `Code` on the bottom-left panel.
  - **Declaration Map:** While in code preview, view a mapped structure of all declarations in the left-side panel for easier navigation and understanding.

- **Custom Code Support:** Write custom Flutter code anywhere in your project, including functions, widgets, and classes. Modify the generated code, and see changes sync instantly inside Nowa. For more, [watch this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlOoXTdw1vg&t=1087s)
- **Themes Management:** Create and manage multiple themes for your app, customize colors and typography, and dynamically switch themes during runtime. [Read more about it here](./ui/themes/)
- **Revamped Logic-Building Circuit:** Build more complex and advanced flows with the new Circuit. Features include:
  - "Await" for asynchronous functions.
  - "Try-Catch" support for functions that may throw exceptions (e.g., network requests).

- **Advanced Expressions:** Write advanced Dart expressions directly in the UI Designer or Circuit. Use the new Advanced Expression Builder to create:
  - Conditional, mathematical, null-aware, and boolean expressions.
- **Integrated Flutter Development:** Instantly sync changes between Nowa and your local Flutter development environment.
- **New File System:** Organize your project with ease:
  - **Dart File Navigation:** Seamlessly navigate between your projectâ€™s Dart files for a more structured workflow.
