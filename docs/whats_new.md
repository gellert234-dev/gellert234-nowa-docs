# What's new

> Discover the latest features and enhancements for each version of Nowa. For more details, check the [changelogs](./change_log.md)

### 1.7.3 (25 July 2024)

We have released several essential improvements to enhance your App building experience with Nowa! Let's see how:

#### **New ‚ú®**

**A complete new ListView and GridView widgets**: These widgets make displaying data easier and more efficient than ever. They come with two modes: `Builder` and `Normal`. The `Builder` mode renders only what is needed at each moment, improving performance when displaying large amounts of data. Read more here about [Using Listview](./ui/widgets/widget_desc/listview.md) and [Gridview](./ui/widgets/widget_desc/gridview.md)

  - Use the `Builder` mode for efficient rendering of large datasets

  :::tip
 For displaying data from an API, Firebase, Supabase, or a variable, use `ListView` and `GridView` instead of the older way of using [Group](./ui/layout/groups.md).

Read [this article](https://community.nowa.dev/t/when-to-use-listview-and-gridview-and-when-to-use-groups/396) to learn when to use `Group` and when to use `ListView` or `GridView`

  :::

**New Linear Progress Indicator**: Along with the circular progress indicator, you can now display a linear progress indicator. [Read more here](./ui/widgets/widget_desc/linear_progress_indicator.md)

  - Set the progress value to indicate task completion
  - Customize the color and background to match your app's theme

**Text Overflow Options**: You can now set behaviors for the Text widget when there's not enough space to show all the text. Options include `clip`, `ellipsis`, and more. [Read more here](./ui/widgets/widget_desc/text.md)

  - Choose `clip` to cut off the extra text
  - Use `ellipsis` to show dots where the text overflows

#### **Enhancements üëÄ**

![](./img_releasenotes/1.6.1.png)


#### **New ‚ú®**

- **Build a fully customized AudioPlayer**: It‚Äôs time for you to build a fully customized Audio player for your app! There‚Äôs multiple ways to so:

  - Use a full Screen template: you will find AudioPlayerPage screen that has a full Audio player screen already built-in.

  - Use the pre-built Audio player component: we have introduced a new tab inside the Screen panel called Components. Inside, you will have already-built components such as a newAudioPlayer component.

  - Build it fully from scratch: with using widgets as the Slider and creating a variable of type AudioPlayerComponent, you can build all the details from scratch. We will release later a tutorial on how to do that but you can already figure it out by looking into the already-built version

- **New Pre-built components**: Inside Screens panel, you will find a new tab called Components that has new pre-built components to import to your project. For now, we introduced AudioPlayer and Google sign in button components. When you click on one of them, Nowa will add that component to your project (it will create a new file in your project for that component. You will be able to reuse it later by heading to Components tab in the widget picker, which usually has your existing project components).

- **Checking current platform in Logic**: If you want to build a condition according to what platform is your app running on, you can do that by using CheckPlatform node in Circuit under Globals section. It will return a boolean value wether the app running on the platform you asked for or not.

- **Control the visibility of widgets**: Wrap any widget under Visibility wrapper to control wether to make it visible or not (you can also attach a logic to the visible property to calculate wether to keep that widget visible or not).

This is useful in cases such as Login screens or Splash screen when you don't want users to be able to go back to those screens after passing them. To use it, you will find a new node called `Navigator` in Circuit.

- **Image picker**: You can now use `Image picker`object in Circuit to enable users to pick images from their gallery or camera.
