description: Using If statements node to control the flow of the logic
---

The **if statement** is one of the most essential control flow nodes you can use in Nowa. It allows your app logic to **branch in two directions**—`True` or `False`—based on a given **condition**.

This is perfect for executing different logic depending on whether something is true or false, like whether a user is logged in or a value is empty.

---

## How to Add an If Statement

To insert an if statement node into your logic flow:

1. Open the **logic nodes menu**.
2. Click the **➕ button** below any existing node.
3. Choose **If Statement** from the list.

:::note[Nested if statements]

You can easily build nested if statements inside each other.

Simply click on + inside the true or false branuch inside the first if statement node and add another if statement there. Here's an example:

## Parts of the If Statement

An if statement node in Nowa has **three main parts**:

- **Condition**  
    This is the logic that decides whether the `True` or `False` branch will be executed. It must return a boolean (`true` or `false`).
    
- **True Branch**  
    This path runs if the condition is `true`. You can add nodes by hovering over the point inside the `True` branch and then clicking the ➕ icon. Nodes are executed from top to bottom.
    
- **False Branch**  
    This runs if the condition is `false`. Add nodes the same way as in the True branch by hovering over the `False` point.

## Visual Overview

Here’s how an if statement looks inside Nowa:

![](/img/circuit/control-flow/if/ifstatement-sections.png)


1. **If Statement Node**  
    Select this node to edit the condition.
    
2. **Condition Field**  
    Once selected, the condition appears in the details panel on the right.
    
3. **True Branch**  
    Hover over the `True` side to add nodes that run when the condition is true.
    
4. **False Branch**  
    Hover over the `False` side to add nodes that run when the condition is false.
    
5. **End of If Statement**  
    Any node added after this point continues the flow beyond the if statement.

## Setting the Condition

The condition field must evaluate to a **boolean value**. There are several ways to set it up:

### 1. Toggle (Default)

You’ll first see a simple toggle. Turning it on means the condition is always true (and the True branch runs), while off means it’s always false.

### 2. Link to a Value

Click on the **condition field** itself in the details panel to open the **linking menu**, which used to connect fields to other parts like variables, etc. You can connect the condition to:

#### - Local Variable or Parameter

Link to a local `Boolean` variable or parameter (for example, `isLoading` boolean that is used to hold the loading state) defined in your screen or component.

#### - Global Variable

Connect to a `Boolean` global state variable from the **Globals** section in the linking menu.

:::warning[Coniditon should be connected to a boolean]

The variable or function that linked with the "condition" must result in a **boolean**—`true` or `false`.
:::

#### - Function (Returns Boolean)

Use a function that returns a boolean.  
To link it:

- If it’s a **local** function, find it in the **Locals** section.
- If it’s a **global** function, go to **Globals**, choose the state, then click ➕ to select the function.

:::note
When linked to a function, the function runs when execution reaches the if statement, and its result is used as the condition.
:::

#### - Custom Expression

Write any custom Dart expression that results in a boolean, for example:

```dart
isLoading == true && user != null
```

#### - Operators

You can build a condition using comparison or logical operators—like `greater than`, `equal`, or `not equal`.

To use them:

1. Inside the linking menu, go to the **Operators** section.
2. Select the operator you want (e.g., `greaterThan`, `Equal`,  `logicalAnd`, etc).
3. Set the **type** for both sides (like `int` if comparing integers).
4. Then set the **left-hand side** and **right-hand side**:
    - You can enter values manually.
    - Or click each side to open the linking menu and connect it to a variable, function, or expression.

**Example**:  
Use the `greaterThanOrEqual` operator to check if a `dailyGoal` variable is greater than or equal to 1400.

:::tip[Use Custom Expression to view or modify the result] 
This same logic could be written directly using **Custom Expression** if you prefer by typing `dailyGoal >= 1400` 

Also, after using an operator node to build the condition, you can open its **Custom Expression** view to see the generated expression for that operator—and modify it if needed.
:::

#### - Compute

This option creates a **custom boolean-returning function** for complex logic.

How it works:

1. Click **Compute** under the condition field.
2. Nowa creates a function and links it to the condition.
3. To edit the function, click its name beside "condition" and choose **Open in Circuit**.
4. You can:
    - Add parameters (e.g., `token`).
    - Pass data into it from the if statement's details panel.
    - Customize the logic to return true/false.

## Notes & Tips

- **Detach a Condition**  
    Click on the condition and press **Detach** to remove any link.
    
- **Create New Variables/Parameters**  
    Inside the linking menu, you can:
    
    - Click **Create Variable** or **Create Param** to instantly generate a new local boolean and link it to the condition.
    - Use **Locals** or **Globals** to connect to existing ones.

The if statement is a powerful way to handle dynamic logic visually. Whether you need a simple toggle or a fully custom condition, you can adapt it easily using variables, functions, or expressions.
