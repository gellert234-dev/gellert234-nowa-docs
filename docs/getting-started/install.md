# Installation  

# ✨ Signup  

When a new user opens the app for the very first time, the adventure begins 🎉. On the signup screen, two doors appear 🔑✨. One is the classic way — creating an account with email and password 📧🔒. The other is the fast lane — signing up with Google 🌍⚡. Both paths lead to the same destination: a brand-new account ready to use 🎊.

### 🏁 The First Step: Choosing Your Path  

The first screen greets the user warmly 👋, offering two clear options. Some prefer to type in their details manually ✍️, while others enjoy the convenience of letting Google handle the process 🤖. It’s a bit like standing at a crossroads 🛤️ — one way takes a little more time, the other is lightning fast ⚡.

### 📧 The Journey with Email  

If the user chooses the email path, the app gently asks for three essentials 👤📩🔑: full name, email address, and a password of their choice. With those details entered, the adventure moves to the next step.

But before the gates open, the app pauses ⏳. A verification email 📬 is sent, and the user must confirm it with a quick click ✅. This ensures the email is real and secure 🔒.

Once confirmed, the doors swing wide open 🎉. The signup is complete, and the user can log in freely whenever they like 🔓💻.

### 🌍 The Express Route with Google  

For those who like speed ⏩, Google signup feels like magic ✨. By tapping the Google button, the familiar login screen appears 👀. The user picks their Google account, grants permission 🙌, and the system does the rest automatically 🤖.

### 🎉 After Signup: Welcome Aboard  

No matter which road was taken 🛤️, both lead to the same bright destination 🌟. The user is greeted by a cheerful welcome screen 👋🎊.  

![After step 1](/img/signup/after/1.png)  

Before diving into the main app, there’s one small setup step 🛠️. Instead of collecting heavy personal data 🙅‍♂️, the app asks a single lightweight question — for example: *“Are you a developer?”* 👨‍💻👩‍💻. This keeps the flow quick ⏱️ and stress-free 😌.

### Dashboard

And once inside the main dashboard 🖥️✨, a whole new world opens up. Here, the user can create brand-new projects 🏗️, revisit and open existing ones 📂, and decide whether to keep their work local 💻 or push it into the cloud ☁️.

### Create workspace:

The dashboard also offers **workspaces** 🗂️, a powerful way to keep everything organized neatly 📑 and to manage projects efficiently ⚙️. It’s like having a control center for all your creative journeys 🚀.

# 📂 Projects: Local or Cloud?  

Once inside, a new decision awaits ⚖️. When creating a project 🏗️, should it live on the local machine 💻 or soar into the cloud ☁️? Both choices offer unique strengths, and the right answer depends on the kind of journey the project will take 🌍.  

---

### ☁️ Cloud Development  

Cloud projects, on the other hand, are like setting up shop in a bustling shared studio 🌟🏢. Files live online 📦, ready to be accessed from anywhere 🌍, shared with teammates 🤝, and scaled to match future growth 📈. This path shines when speed 🚀, collaboration 👥, and global accessibility 🌐 are priorities.

### 💻 Local Development  

Keeping projects local feels like working in your own workshop 🛠️🏡. Everything stays safe inside your computer 🖥️, protected from the outside world 🔒. This approach is perfect when working offline 📴, when dealing with sensitive information 🗄️, or when testing on simulators 👨‍🔬. It gives complete control ⚙️ and independence.

### 🎯 Making the Choice  

In the end, there is no wrong path 🙅‍♂️. Some journeys are best taken locally 🏡, others belong in the cloud ☁️. What matters most is picking the environment that fits your needs today and tomorrow 🗓️. Whichever you choose, the app is ready to walk beside you 👣✨.
