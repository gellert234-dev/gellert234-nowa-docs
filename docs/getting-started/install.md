# Installation  

# ✨ Signup  

When a new user opens the app for the very first time, the adventure begins 🎉. The signup screen appears like a pair of doors 🔑✨. One path is the traditional route — creating an account with email and password 📧🔒. The other is the express lane — signing up with Google 🌍⚡. No matter which way the user chooses, both lead to the same destination: a brand-new account, ready to explore 🎊.

### 🏁 The First Step: Choosing Your Path  

The very first screen offers a friendly welcome 👋, presenting two clear choices. Some people prefer to take their time, typing in their details manually ✍️. Others enjoy the convenience of letting Google take care of the process 🤖. It feels a little like standing at a crossroads 🛤️: one road takes a few extra steps, the other is lightning fast ⚡.

### 📧 The Journey with Email  

For those who pick the email route, the app gently asks for three essentials 👤📩🔑: full name, email address, and a password. Once these are filled in, the process moves forward.

Before the account is ready, the app sends out a verification email 📬. The user needs to confirm their address with a quick click ✅. This step ensures security 🔒 and verifies that the email is real.

As soon as the email is confirmed, the doors swing wide open 🎉. The signup journey is complete, and the user can now log in freely whenever they wish 🔓💻.

### 🌍 The Express Route with Google  

For those who prefer speed ⏩, signing up with Google feels almost like magic ✨. A single tap brings up the familiar Google login screen 👀. The user selects their account, grants permission 🙌, and the rest happens automatically 🤖.

### 🎉 After Signup: Welcome  

No matter which road was taken 🛤️, both journeys lead to the same destination 🌟 — a cheerful welcome screen 👋🎊.  

![After step 1](/img/signup/after/1.png)  

Before diving into the main app, there’s one small setup step 🛠️. Instead of asking for heavy personal details 🙅‍♂️, the app poses a single lightweight question — something like *“Are you a developer?”* 👨‍💻👩‍💻. This keeps the experience quick ⏱️ and stress-free 😌.

# 🎉🚀 Exploring App.nowa.dev  

When the user arrives at **app.nowa.dev**, they step into the **Nowa dashboard** 🖥️📊. This is the central hub where projects are created 🛠️, organized 🧩, and managed with ease ⚡.  

---

# Dashboard  

Inside the dashboard, an entire world unfolds. Here, users can start fresh by creating brand-new projects 🏗️, reopen existing ones 📂, and decide whether their work should stay local 💻 or be launched into the cloud ☁️.  

On the left side, a sidebar acts like a trusty guide. It offers access to cloud and local projects 🌥️💻, organizes them into workspaces 🗂️, and even provides quick links to sample templates 📝🎨 and learning resources 🎥📖. From here, users can also install the desktop version 🖥️, suggest new templates 💡, or adjust account settings 🔧. When the journey for the day is done, logging out is just a click away 👋.  

In the main area, cloud projects appear as cards 🃏 with preview images 🖼️. Each card offers a simple way to jump back into editing ✏️.  

At the top right corner, tools for searching 🔍 and creating new cloud projects ➕🆕 make navigation fast and effortless.

### Creating a Workspace  

For those who like structure, workspaces provide a powerful way to stay organized 📑. Think of them as control centers where projects are neatly arranged and managed efficiently ⚙️.

# 📂 Projects: Local or Cloud?  

When starting a project, the user faces a new decision ⚖️: should the work live on the local machine 💻, or should it soar into the cloud ☁️? Both paths offer unique strengths, and the best choice depends on the journey ahead 🌍.  

---

### ☁️ Cloud Development  

Choosing the cloud feels like setting up in a shared creative studio 🌟🏢. Projects are stored online 📦, accessible from anywhere 🌍, and easy to share with teammates 🤝. This approach shines when collaboration 👥, speed 🚀, and global access 🌐 are the priorities.

### 💻 Local Development  

Keeping projects local feels more like working in a private workshop 🛠️🏡. Everything remains safely inside the user’s own computer 🖥️, protected from outside access 🔒. This path is ideal when working offline 📴, handling sensitive information 🗄️, or testing in simulators 👨‍🔬. It offers full control ⚙️ and independence.  

👉 For a deeper look at local projects, see [this guide](..\local-project-simulator\createlocalproject.md).

### 🎯 Making the Choice  

In the end, there is no wrong decision 🙅‍♂️. Some journeys are better suited to the privacy of local development 🏡, while others thrive in the shared, connected space of the cloud ☁️. What matters most is choosing the environment that fits today’s needs and tomorrow’s ambitions 🗓️. Whichever road is taken, the app is always ready to walk beside the user 👣✨.
