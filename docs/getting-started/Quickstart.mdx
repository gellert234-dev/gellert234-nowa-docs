# Qucikstart - Your First Project

Welcome! 👋 In this tutorial, you’ll see how easy it is to build a stopwatch app using **Nowa**. The process is just three magical steps: **✨ create the project, 💡 describe the goal for AI, and 🎨 change the color visually**. Then you can instantly **👀 see the results**!

---

## 🛠️ Step 1: Create the Project
Start by creating a **new project in Nowa**. No coding, no setup — just open a blank canvas and let the AI do the work. 🌟

## 💡 Step 2: Describe the Goal for AI
Tell Nowa’s AI assistant exactly what you want:

```markdown
Create a simple stopwatch app ⏱ in Flutter. It should use only one button to control the stopwatch. The button behavior depends on the current state:

If the stopwatch is idle (0:00 and not running), the button shows 'Start' and starts the stopwatch.

If the stopwatch is running, the button shows 'Stop' and pauses the stopwatch.

If the stopwatch is paused (stopped but not at 0:00), the button shows 'Reset' and resets the stopwatch back to 0:00.
```

✨ The AI will instantly generate the full app for you:
- 🕒 A time display in the center.
- 🔘 A button that switches between Start, Stop, and Reset.
- ⚡ Logic that automatically handles the transitions.

No coding required — the stopwatch is ready in seconds! 🎉

## 🎨 Step 3: Change the Color (Visually, Without Coding!)
Here’s the real magic: even though AI generates all the code, you don’t need coding knowledge to customize it! 🙌

- Open the **color picker tool** in Nowa. 🎨
- Change the background 🌈, button 🔵, and text ✍️ visually.
- Instantly see the updates without touching a single line of code. 💖

This means **anyone can personalize the app** easily, no programming required. 🪄

## 👀 Step 4: See the Results
Run your app inside Nowa and test it:
- ▶️ Press **Start** → stopwatch runs.
- ⏹️ Press **Stop** → stopwatch pauses.
- 🔄 Press **Reset** → stopwatch resets to 0:00.

And it all happens with **your chosen colors and style**! 🌟

That’s it — just **3 simple steps**:  
1️⃣ Create the project 🛠️  
2️⃣ Describe the goal to AI 💡  
3️⃣ Change the colors visually 🎨 (no coding knowledge needed!)  

👉 The result: a fully working stopwatch app ⏱️, built by **AI magic ✨** and customized by **you**! 🙌
