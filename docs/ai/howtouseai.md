# How to use Nowa AI

The AI editing tool helps you quickly make changes to your app. Here's your complete journey from start to finish.

---

## 🚀 Getting Started: Your AI Journey

**When you first open the AI tool**, you'll start with a clean slate—no attachments, just you and the AI ready to create. Think of it as beginning a collaborative story where you're the director and the AI is your skilled assistant.

**The Story Begins:**
1. **Start simple** - Describe what you want to build or change
2. **Add context** - Select screens or widgets to give the AI focus
3. **Enhance with visuals** - Upload images for design inspiration

## ✨ Features & Benefits

### 🎯 Smart Selection & Context

**How it works:** When you select a screen or widget in your app, it automatically gets added as an attachment to your AI conversation. This gives the AI precise context about what you're working on.

👉 **Benefit:** The AI understands exactly what you want to edit, making suggestions more accurate and targeted.

*Example: Select your login form, and the AI will focus only on improving that specific component.*

### 🖼️ Apply Changes Everywhere

Tell the AI what you'd like to edit, and it can apply changes directly to an entire screen or to individual widgets across your app.

👉 **Benefit:** Saves you time by applying consistent edits everywhere at once.

*Example: Change all button colors to blue in seconds, maintaining design consistency.*

### 📎 Attach Images for Inspiration

**Multiple ways to add visual context:**
- **Upload from your device** - Add screenshots, mockups, or design references
- **Use your app files** - Access images already in your project
- **Convert UI to images** - Turn your existing screens into reference images

👉 **Benefit:** Provides visual clarity to help the AI match your exact style and vision.

*Example: Upload a Pinterest design and ask the AI to recreate that aesthetic in your app.*

### 🔄 Safe Experimentation

If you don't like what the AI generated, you can easily undo and go back to the previous version.

👉 **Benefit:** Lets you experiment boldly without risk—try wild ideas knowing you can always revert.

*Example: Test a completely new layout—if it doesn't work, roll back instantly and try something else.*

### 🆕 Fresh Starts

Begin a new chat session to explore different ideas without carrying over previous conversation context.

👉 **Benefit:** Gives you a clean slate for entirely new creative directions.

*Example: Start fresh to redesign your profile page after finishing work on the home screen.*
