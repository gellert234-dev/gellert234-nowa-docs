The AI editing tool helps you quickly make changes to your app.

## ✨ Features & Benefits  

### 🖼️ Apply to screens/widgets  
Tell the AI what you’d like to edit, and it can apply changes directly to an entire screen or to individual widgets.  

👉 **Benefit:** Saves you time by applying edits everywhere at once.  
*Example: Change all button colors to blue in seconds.*

---

### 🎯 Targeted edits (AI context)  
By specifying a widget or screen, the AI focuses only on that area. This makes edits more accurate and keeps other parts of your app untouched.  

👉 **Benefit:** Keeps your app precise and safe.  
*Example: Update just the login button text without touching the rest of the page.*

### 📎 Attach an image  
You can upload or attach an image to show the AI how your app looks. This is useful for visual guidance when making design changes.  

👉 **Benefit:** Provides visual clarity to help the AI match your style.  
*Example: Upload a screenshot and ask the AI to match the header design.*

### 🔄 Undo changes  
If you don’t like what the AI generated, you can easily undo and go back to the previous version.  

👉 **Benefit:** Lets you experiment safely without risk.  
*Example: Try a new layout — if it doesn’t fit, roll back instantly.*

### 🆕 Starting a new chat  
Begin a fresh session with the AI to explore new changes without carrying over previous edits.  

👉 **Benefit:** Gives you a clean start for new ideas.  
*Example: Start a new chat to redesign the profile page separately from the home screen edits.*  

<video src="/videos/ai/newchat.webm" controls width="100%" />
