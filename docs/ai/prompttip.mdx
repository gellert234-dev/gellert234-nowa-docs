# Prompting Tips

Nowa AI can design, code, and integrate your Flutter app with just a few prompts. The better you guide it, the better your results.

This guide shares practical tips to write prompts that help Nowa AI work faster, avoid mistakes, and deliver what you need.

## 1️⃣ Keep it small — one step at a time

Big, vague prompts can lead to unexpected results.  
Break your requests into smaller, clear steps so the AI can focus and you can quickly review and adjust.

✅ **Good:** `Add a search bar to my product list screen.`  
❌ **Risky:** `Build me a full shopping app with everything.`

## 2️⃣ Attach when it matters

When modifying something specific, attach that file, screen, or widget to your prompt.  
This gives the AI:

- A precise starting point  
- Faster focus on the relevant code  
- Less chance of unrelated changes  

👉 You don’t need to attach all dependencies — just the main element you’re working on. If the AI needs more, it will fetch it.

## 3️⃣ Make attachments as focused as possible

- If you want to update a specific widget, select **only that widget** — not the entire screen.  
- If Nowa AI needs more context from the surrounding screen, it will go find it.  

🎯 Focused attachments help the AI make better decisions and avoid unnecessary edits.

## 4️⃣ Give context — reduce assumptions

AI works best when it understands the bigger picture.  
Context could include:

- The purpose of the screen or feature  
- Key design or functional elements  
- Relevant background or user flow  

The more context you give, the fewer assumptions the AI has to make.

## 5️⃣ Start a new chat when context drifts

When your next request isn’t closely related to the current thread, start a fresh chat.  
Old conversations can bias the AI toward previous topics and decisions.

**Why it helps:**  
- Keeps the AI focused on the current goal  
- Reduces accidental carry-over from older prompts  
- Improves clarity and results — especially when switching features  

✅ **Good:**  
`New chat: Build an ‘Orders’ screen with filters (status, date). Attach orders_list.dart.`  

❌ **Risky:**  
`Same chat about homepage styling: Also add Supabase auth and reset password.`  

📌 **Rule of thumb:** Keep a chat to ~5 prompts. If you’re switching features or the thread feels unrelated, start a new one and attach the relevant screen/widget.

## 6️⃣ Master the Sandwich Technique (Intent → Context → Task → Constraints)

The “prompt sandwich” is a simple but powerful structure:

1. **Intent** — State what you want to achieve  
2. **Context** — Add relevant background info (bullet points work great)  
3. **Task** — Tell the AI exactly what to do  
4. **Constraints** — Any rules or limits the AI must follow  

**Example:**

```text
#Intent
I want to build a modern homepage for my shoe store app.

#Context
• Show main promotion at the top
• Display products in a grid with price and image
• Mobile-first approach

#Task
Build the homepage as described above.

#Constraints
Keep the design clean and modern, and the implementation simple.
