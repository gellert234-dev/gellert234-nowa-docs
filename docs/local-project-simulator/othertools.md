# Using Other Tools on a Local Project: Git & IDE 🛠️

When working on a local project in **Nowa**, you’re not limited to the built-in editor.  
You can seamlessly use **Git** 🌀 and your own **IDE** 💻 (like VS Code, IntelliJ, PyCharm, etc.) alongside it.  

## ⚙️ How It Works
- Open your project locally in your favorite **IDE** 💻.  
- Use **Git** 🌀 as you normally would: commit ✅, push ⬆️, pull ⬇️, or checkout new branches 🌿.  
- Any code changes you make are automatically 🔄 synchronized back into **Nowa**.  
- You can see these updates in real-time ⏱️, without breaking your workflow 🚀.

## 🎯 Why This Is Good for You
- **Familiar Environment** 🏠: Keep coding in the IDE you’re most comfortable with.  
- **Version Control** 📂: Safely manage changes, collaborate 🤝, and roll back if needed.  
- **Smooth Workflow** 🧘: No need to copy-paste or manually import code — changes flow automatically.  
- **Flexibility** 🔀: Switch between low-code design in **Nowa** and full-code editing in your IDE effortlessly.  

## 🌐 How to Imagine It
Think of it like two windows 🪟 looking at the same project:  
- One is **Nowa** ✨, where you design, configure, and manage the project visually.  
- The other is your **IDE** 💻, where you dive deep into the code.  

Change something in one window, and the other updates instantly ⚡.  
You never lose context, and your workflow stays uninterrupted 🚀.
